# Banking Functions
Writing clean efficient code is what adds real value when programing enterprise software.
It's also proven that the quality of the code is directly correlated to the capability of the product. 

See for yourself how our digital 'Banking Functions' provide real benefit when self servicing 
consumers demands with continued prevention of errors and frauds.

Check out the 'Banking Functions' math now on [GitHub](./bank-functions.js) specifically written by ToucheComm for open source 
using one of the most common developer coding languages online 'JavaScript'. 

### Future Value = FV (rate,nper,pmt,(pv),(type))
The Future Value (FV) function helps calculate the future value of investments made
by a business, assuming periodic, constant payments with a constant interest rate.

It is useful in evaluating low-risk investments such as certificates of deposit or
fixed rate annuities with low interest rates. It can also be used in relation to
interest paid on loans.

### Present Value = PV (rate, nper, pmt, (fv), (type))
The Present Value (PV) is used to calculate the dollar value of future payments in 
the present time. For multiple payments, we assume periodic, fixed payments and a fixed interest rate.

Alternatively, the function can also be used to calculate the present value of a single future value.

### Principal-/Interest = PPMT (rate, per, nper, pv, (fv), (type)) 
The PPMT function will calculate the payment on the principal for a loan or an 
investment based on periodic, constant payments and a fixed interest rate for a given 
period of time.
